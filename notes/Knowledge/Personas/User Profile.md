# User Profiles
- Often used synonymously with [[Persona]]s but sometimes only provides a demographic sketch and superficial narrative.
- Risk becoming based on stereotypes if not grounded in ethnographic data and lacking in-depth information about user behaviors and motivations.
- Effective when they encapsulate a deep understanding of the user, transcending mere demographic details to include motivations, needs, and usage patterns.
- Names, family details, or other [[Persona]]l attributes are used sparingly, mainly as narrative tools to bring the data to life.
