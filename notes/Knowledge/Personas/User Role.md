# User Role
- Defined as an abstraction of the relationship between a class of users and their problems, including needs, interests, expectations, and behavior patterns.
- Tend to focus on tasks without adequately conveying human motivations and the broader context of user behaviors.
- Limitations include a lack of empathy engagement due to abstract representation and an overemphasis on tasks over goals.
- User roles simplify complex user distinctions and similarities, potentially overlooking the nuanced differences between users in similar roles.

[[Persona]]s provide a more holistic view than user roles, and mitigates many of the drawbacks of user roles, while still describing the same type of behaviors and relationships
