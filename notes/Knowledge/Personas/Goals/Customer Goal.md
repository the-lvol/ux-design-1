# Customer Goal
"Consumer customers are often parents, relatives, or friends who often have concerns about the safety and happiness of the persons for whom they are purchasing the product. Enterprise customers are typically IT managers"

- Differ between **consumer** (e.g., safety, happiness) and **enterprise** products (e.g., security, ease of maintenance).
- **Customer [[Persona]]s** may have their own **life**, **experience**, and **end goals** related to the product.
- Should be acknowledged but not prioritized over **end goals**.
