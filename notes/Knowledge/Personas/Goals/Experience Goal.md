# Experience Goal
Related to [[Visceral]]

- Defined as **simple, universal, and personal**, making them challenging to articulate in business contexts.
- Express **how someone wants to feel** while using a product or the quality of their interaction with it.
- Influence the product's **visual and aural characteristics**, **interactive feel** (e.g., animated transitions, latency, snap ratio of buttons), and **physical design**.
- Aim to align with **[[Persona]] motivations** at the **visceral level**.
- Examples include desires to:
  - Feel **smart or in control**.
  - **Have fun**.
  - Feel **cool, hip, or relaxed**.
  - **Remain focused and alert**.
- Negative experiences (e.g., feeling stupid or uncomfortable) can lower **self-esteem** and **effectiveness**, increase **resentment**, and may lead to **system subversion** by users.
- Products failing to meet experience goals will likely **fail** regardless of success in other areas.

## Design Implications
- **Interaction, visual, and industrial designers** must convert [[Persona]] experience goals into **form, behavior, motion, and auditory elements** that convey the intended feel, affect, emotion, and tone.
- **Visual language studies** and **mood or inspiration boards** are tools for establishing visual themes that reflect **[[Persona]] attitudes and behaviors**, aiding in defining the **tonal expectations** of [[Persona]]s.
