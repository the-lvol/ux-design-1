# Business And Organizational Goals
- Organizations have goals for products/services that need modeling and consideration in design.
- Business goals can include:
  - **Increase profit**
  - **Increase market share**
  - **Retain customers**
  - **Defeat competition**
  - **Use resources efficiently**
  - **Offer more products/services**
- The goals of non-business organizations (e.g., museums, and nonprofits) also need consideration, like **educating the public** or **raising funds**. Though many of them are ran like businesses
