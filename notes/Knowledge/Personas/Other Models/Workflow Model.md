# Workflow Model
- Capture information flow and decision-making within organizations.
- Expressed as flow charts or directed graphs, covering:
  - Goals/desired outcomes.
  - Process frequency, importance, initiators, and dependencies.
  - Involved people, their roles, and responsibilities.
  - Specific actions, decisions made, and supporting information.
  - Errors, exceptions, and their corrections.
- Essential for capturing interpersonal and organizational workflows.
- Risk of creating a "business implementation model" that lacks humanity.
