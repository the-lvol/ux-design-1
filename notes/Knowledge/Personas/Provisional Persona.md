# Provisional Persona
- Used when there's a lack of time, resources, or corporate buy-in for detailed qualitative data collection.
- Serve as **rhetorical tools** to communicate assumptions about users and their needs, promoting rigorous thinking about specific user needs, even if unvalidated.
- Structured like real personas but based on available data, stakeholder knowledge, subject matter expert insights, and existing market data.
- Act as a more detailed persona hypothesis, useful for focusing product teams and building consensus around features and behaviors despite their provisional nature.
- **Caveats** include potential misfocus on design targets, missing key behaviors, difficulty in gaining buy-in, and risking the long-term credibility of personas.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Clearly label and explain their provisional status.
  - Use sketches instead of photos to highlight their temporary nature.
  - Utilize as much existing data as possible to inform these personas.
  - Document the data used and assumptions made to avoid stereotypes.
  - Focus on behaviors and motivations over demographics.
