# Persona Goals
- **Context and Drivers**: Goals provide context for observed behaviors, serving as the primary motivation behind these behaviors.
- **Utility in Design**: A persona without goals lacks utility as a design tool, whereas user goals guide the design of product functions and behaviors.
- **Tasks and Goals**: Product functions must address user goals through tasks, aiming to minimize the number of tasks required to achieve these goals.

User goals are user motivations

## Motivation and Usage Patterns
- Goals motivate personas to behave in certain ways, explaining **why** and **how** they use a product.
- Serve as shorthand for designers to understand complex behaviors and the associated tasks of a persona.
  
## Inference from Qualitative Data
- Goals are usually inferred from qualitative data rather than directly asked, due to people's inability to accurately articulate them.
- Designers and researchers reconstruct goals from observed behaviors, answers to indirect questions, nonverbal cues, and environmental clues.
- Identifying goals is a critical task in persona modeling, requiring goals to be succinctly expressed in simple sentences.

## Designing for visual responses ([[Norman's Three Levels of Cognition]])
    harmonize elements of visceral design and reflective design with a focus on behavioral design.

- Design should address all three levels to fully engage users, supporting intuitive decision-making ([[Visceral]]), enhancing usability ([[Behavioral]]), and fostering meaningful connections with products ([[Reflective]]).
- Understanding these cognitive processes helps designers create products that are not only functional but also emotionally resonant.

### Designing for [[Visceral]]
- Focuses on designing for the senses' initial perception, primarily visual appearance, motion, and possibly sound and tactile sensations.
- Misconception: Visceral design is often mistakenly equated with designing for beauty. However, it's about eliciting the appropriate emotional or psychological response, not just aesthetics.
- **Affect vs. Aesthetics**: Visceral design targets the right effect for the context, which goes beyond mere beauty to include feelings suitable for the product's purpose (e.g., security for online banking, and pleasure for MP3 players).
- **User Interface Attractiveness**: Attractive interfaces are often perceived as more usable, a belief that can persist despite contradictory experiences. This suggests that perceived ease of use may encourage users to invest more effort into learning the interface.
- **Designer Responsibility**: Ensures that if the user interface makes a visceral promise (e.g., ease of use), it must deliver on that promise at the behavioral level to maintain user trust and satisfaction.

### Designing for [[Behavioral]]
- Focuses on designing product behaviors that align with user behaviors, assumptions, and mental models.
- **Behavioral Design**: Most familiar to interaction designers, emphasizing the fit between product functionality and user expectations.
- **Norman's Three-Level Model**: Asserts that behavioral processing is influenced by and influences both visceral and reflective levels, suggesting its central role in design.
- **Primary Design Focus**: Day-to-day behavioral aspects should be the main focus, with visceral and reflective design supporting the overall user experience.
- Importance: Correct behavioral design, supported by adequate attention to visceral and reflective levels, maximizes positive user experience construction.
- **User Experience Harmony**: A product's user experience should integrate visceral, reflective, and behavioral design elements to ensure consistency between initial impressions and actual use.

### Designing for [[Reflective]]
- Focuses on building long-term product relationships by engaging users' reflective processing, which contemplates personal and cultural associations.
- **Challenge**: It's unclear how to ensure success at the reflective level, whether by chance or through deliberate design efforts.
- **Examples of Reflective Design**: High-concept designs like impractically configured teapots and Philippe Starck's juicer demonstrate appeal through aesthetic statements, influencing users' desires for uniqueness or cultural sophistication.
- **Balance Between Style and Function**: Products like the Apple iPod illustrate the potential for balancing stylistic appeal with functionality, fostering strong emotional connections through design and user experience.
- **Iconic Products**: Some products become iconic by transcending their utility and resonating deeply with users' personal or cultural identities, such as the Sony Walkman and iPod.
- **Opportunity for Reflective Meaning**: When a product's design addresses users' goals and motivations, even beyond its primary function, it enhances the potential for creating reflective meaning.

## The Three Types of Goals
Successful products meet user goals first

### The user goals
![[Experience Goal]]

![[End Goal]]

![[Life Goal]]

### The non-user goals
Must be met at the cost of the user experience

![[Customer Goal]]

![[Business And Organizational Goals]]

![[Technical Goals]]
