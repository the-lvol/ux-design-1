# Customer Persona
- Interaction design sometimes requires considering the needs and goals of **nonusers** who influence the design process, even if they don't directly use the product.
- **Customer personas** represent those who purchase but do not use the product, common in **enterprise software** and **children's toys**.
- These [[Persona]]s should be based on **observed behavior patterns** through **ethnographic research**, similar to user [[Persona]]s.
- In medical products, **patients** may not interact with the user interface but have distinct motivations and objectives from the clinicians who do. **Served personas** can represent these patient needs.
- Understanding both **user and nonuser** [[Persona]]s helps in designing products that consider all relevant perspectives and needs.
