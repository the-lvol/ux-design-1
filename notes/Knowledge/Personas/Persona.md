# Persona
    Personas are fictional archetypes created based on the behaviors and motivations of real users observed during research. They are not real individuals but embody the collective characteristics of user groups.

- Objective: To provide a clear, focused way to consider user behaviors, needs, goals, and motivations throughout the design process.
- Designing for a **broad audience** by increasing functionality can **increase cognitive load** and **navigational overhead**, reducing satisfaction.
- Using personas helps in designing for **key constituents**, and prioritizing **primary users**** while considering **secondary users**.
- Aim to **reduce complexity** in design by targeting it towards **specific user needs**, enhancing **user satisfaction**.

## Personas as Individual People
- Personas are **user models** represented as specific, individual human beings, synthesized from observations of real people.
- They are **not actual people** but **personifications** created to engage the empathy of the design and development teams toward the human targets of the design.
- Empathy is crucial for designers to make informed decisions based on the **cognitive and emotional dimensions** of the persona, particularly focusing on the personaâ€™s goals.
- Personas also make design solutions more compelling to stakeholders by encouraging them to view the personas as real individuals, thereby increasing their interest in creating a satisfying product experience.
- The effectiveness of personas is akin to the engagement viewers feel with fictional characters in books, movies, and TV shows, leveraging the power of storytelling and character development to enhance design empathy and insight.
- The creation and use of personas are compared to **method acting**, where actors deeply understand and embody their characters, suggesting that personas help designers and developers deeply understand and cater to their users.

## Development and Use of Personas
- Research Phase: Involves gathering behavioral data from users through ethnographic interviews and observations.
- Modeling Phase: Identifies significant behavior patterns and formalizes these into personas, representing a wide range of users.
- Design Impact: Personas guide design decisions by offering a user-centered perspective, ensuring that designs meet real user needs and goals.

## Advantages of Using Personas
- Enhanced Communication: Facilitates clear discussions about user needs and behaviors among design teams.
- Focused Design Strategy: Helps in prioritizing features and design elements that align with user goals.
- Evidence-based Decisions: Personas are grounded in real user data, providing a strong foundation for design choices.

### Strength
- Personas help **define product functionality and behavior** based on user goals and tasks.
- They **facilitate communication** among stakeholders, developers, and designers by providing a common language focused on user needs.
- **Build consensus and commitment** by offering a relatable narrative structure, simplifying complex user behaviors into understandable stories.
- Enable **measurement of design effectiveness** by allowing designs to be tested against personas, acting as a reality-check and promoting early and cost-effective design iteration.
- **Inform other organizational efforts** like marketing and sales, as personas provide detailed insights into user profiles that can guide strategic planning.
- Address specific design challenges such as:
  - **The elastic user**: Prevents vague or overly flexible user definitions that can complicate design scope.
  - **Self-referential design**: Avoids designs based too heavily on the designers' own preferences rather than user needs.
  - **Edge cases**: Helps manage and prioritize exceptional user scenarios without overwhelming the main design focus.

## Comparison with Other Modeling Techniques
- Other Models: Workflow models and physical models are also useful but may not provide as comprehensive a user understanding.
- Integration Potential: Personas can incorporate elements from other models, offering a holistic view of user interaction with the product.

## Implementation Considerations
- Avoiding Stereotypes: Effective personas require avoiding generalizations and stereotypes, focusing instead on meaningful user behavior patterns.
- Rigor and Sophistication: The process demands careful analysis and synthesis of research data to create accurate and representative personas.


## Based on research
A persona should always be based on research (interview with users), but the following techniques can supplement the issues

- Interviews with users outside of their use contexts
- Information about users supplied by stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs)
- Market research data such as focus groups and surveys
- Market-segmentation models
- Data gathered from literature reviews and previous studies

## Personas Represent Groups of Users
- Though depicted as individuals, personas function as **archetypes**, representing a class or type of user for a specific product.
- They encapsulate **behavior patterns** and **specific motivations or goals**, identified through **interview data** and supported by **quantitative data**.
- Personas are **composite user archetypes**, assembled from related usage patterns observed across individuals in similar roles.

### Personas and Reuse
- Personas must be **context-specific** to be effective, focusing on behaviors and goals related to the domain of a particular product.
- They cannot be easily reused across products, as they are constructed from observations of users in specific contexts.
- For multiple products, personas must be based on research concerning the usage contexts for all products, challenging the identification of coherent behavior patterns across different contexts.

### Archetypes vs. Stereotypes
- Persona archetypes should not be confused with stereotypes, which represent biases and assumptions rather than factual data.
- Stereotypes are the antithesis of well-developed personas and can degrade to stereotypical caricatures if not developed with adequate research and empathy.
- Personas will require dignity and respect in their development, reflecting the people they represent without falling into stereotypes.
- Persona demographics should be a composite reflection of the observed interview population, aiming for diversity and avoiding stereotypical characteristics unless they are crucial to the design or its acceptance.

## Personas Explore Ranges of Behavior
Question: if we need a set of personas in order to not just have the mean persona, isn't that just a persona for each cluster in a data set, hence we get a set of mean personas in regards to each cluster?

- Target markets describe demographics, lifestyles, and sometimes job roles but not the **range of behaviors** related to the product.
- Personas aim to express **exemplary or definitive behaviors** within identified ranges, not to establish an average user.
- Products must accommodate **ranges of user behavior, attitudes, and aptitudes**, necessitating the identification of multiple personas for any given product.
- **Multiple personas** divide behavior into discrete clusters, representing different correlated behavior patterns.
- These correlations are determined through **analyzing research data**, focusing on identifying specific behaviors rather than general averages.

## Personas Must Have Motivations
- Humans have motivations driving their behaviors, ranging from **obvious to subtle**.
- Personas must capture these motivations as [[Persona Goal]]s, which act as shorthand for motivations.
- Goals help identify **specific usage patterns** and explain **why** those behaviors exist.
- Understanding the **why** behind user tasks enables designers to **improve or eliminate** tasks while still achieving the same goals.
