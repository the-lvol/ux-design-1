# Persona Development

## Data-Driven [[Persona]] Development

### Why
Key issue: Personas are not believable due to a lack of data-based creation or unclear data relationships. This method tries to fix, this by making it easier to achieve the needed data

### Methodology Overview
- Involves changing the traditional order of persona development activities (See [[Persona Construction]]).
- Focuses on stakeholder involvement to define meaningful persona attributes (e.g. a client team that needs to develop a solution for the people behind the personas).
- Utilizes surveys and [[Factor Analysis]] to allow [[Persona]] groups to emerge organically.

### Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis
- [[Factor analysis]] was used to identify work task groupings and create persona groups.
- Interviews were conducted to provide qualitative insights into the survey results.
  - Originally not intended, but ended up also being a validation technique
