# Models
    Models serve as abstract representations to simplify complex real-world phenomena, aiding in understanding and decision-making.

Application: Used across various disciplines, models help describe complex behaviors or systems, such as market behaviors in economics or particle behavior in physics.

Core Function: They organize raw, unstructured data into a coherent structure, highlighting important features and downplaying less significant details.

## Models in Design and Development
- Application Across Fields: Models find extensive use not just in design and development but also in scientific disciplines for representing complex phenomena.
- Enhancing Understanding: By emphasizing salient features, models facilitate a deeper understanding of complex systems or relationships.

## Importance in UX Design
- Designing for Users: Essential for understanding and visualizing key aspects of user interactions with each other, their environments, and the products being designed.
- Analogy with Sciences: Just as scientists model atoms to understand physical phenomena, designers model users to grasp behavioral patterns and interactions.
