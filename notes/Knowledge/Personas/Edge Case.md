# Edge Case
  - Refers to designing for **unlikely situations** that may occur but are not common for the target [[Persona]]s.
  - While it's necessary to account for edge cases in design and development, they **should not dominate** the design focus.
  - [[Persona]]s serve as a **reality check**, helping to assess the relevance and frequency of specific functions or operations for the user.
  - This approach enables designers to **prioritize features** more effectively, ensuring that the primary needs of the user are met without being overshadowed by less relevant functionalities.
