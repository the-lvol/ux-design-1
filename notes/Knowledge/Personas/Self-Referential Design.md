# Self-Referential Design
- Occurs when designers or developers **project their own goals, motivations, skills, and mental models** onto the product, leading to designs that appeal primarily to themselves.
- This approach results in "cool" designs that may not be suitable for a broader audience, limiting the product's usability to those similar to the creator.
- Programmers may also engage in self-referential design by creating products that reflect their understanding of data structures and software operations, which can be **alienating to nonprogrammers**.
- Self-referential design is **appropriate for niche products** targeted at users with similar expertise to the designers but is **inappropriate for products intended for a broader audience**.
- The use of [[Persona]]s can mitigate the risks of self-referential design by ensuring that product designs are grounded in the needs and perspectives of the intended user base rather than the creators' preferences.
