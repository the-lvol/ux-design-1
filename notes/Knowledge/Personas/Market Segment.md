# Market Segment
- Focus on demographics, distribution channels, and purchasing behaviors, which are different from [[Persona]]s that are based on usage behavior and motivations.
- Useful in informing the demographic range for [[Persona]] development but does not directly translate to [[Persona]]s.
- Can act as an initial filter in the [[Persona]] development process, limiting the scope of interviews to individuals within the target market.
- The relationship between user [[Persona]]s and market segments informs strategic product definition decisions, integrating market intelligence with design insights.
