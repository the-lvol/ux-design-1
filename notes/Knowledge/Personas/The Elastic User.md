# The Elastic User
- The term "user" is often imprecise, leading to a **variable and convenient definition** of users based on individual team member perceptions.
- This flexibility allows the product development team to justify design choices that fit their preferences rather than addressing **real user needs**, resulting in designs that serve an **"elastic user."**
- Real users, as opposed to the elastic concept, have **specific requirements** based on their **goals, capabilities, and contexts**.
- Using [[Persona]]s counters the issue of the elastic user by providing detailed, consistent representations of **real user needs** and preventing design decisions from bending to fit team biases.
- Designing for generalized user roles or job titles without considering the **varied needs within these groups** introduces **unproductive elasticity**, compromising product effectiveness.
- Precision in defining the user is crucial for a **clear, effective product design** that genuinely meets the needs of its intended audience.
