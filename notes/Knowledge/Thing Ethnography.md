# Thing Ethnography
    Equipped with software and sensors, things can begin to provide access to fields and perspectives that would not be otherwise attainable by human ethnographers. We call the collection and interpretation of these perspectives thing ethnography

- Recognizes the **interdependent relationship** between people and objects, suggesting a shift in design and anthropology to equally consider non-human actors.
- Proposes **thing perspective** as a means for collaborative problem-solving between humans and non-humans, facilitated by **software and sensors** in objects.
- Extremely relevant for the IoT space

## Quick and dirty
Slap a bunch of cameras and sensors on objects, e.g. a kettle and a cup, and have them take pictures and measurements throughout the day. This should lead to interesting discoveries of interactions that could only be determined using this method

## Insights

### Insight 1 - Things that move
    Things that move through space occupy multiple ecosystems and are also the connector among these ecosystems

Below are also the points of insight 2

- **Differences in dynamism and emplacement**: The study highlights variations in how objects in kitchens and dining rooms exhibit movement and static behavior.
  - **Movement vs. Stasis**: Items are categorized based on their mobility, from those that move freely to those confined within a specific space.
  - **Community and Relationships**: The movement of objects reflects their interrelation within a network of items and practices, suggesting a complex ecosystem of interactions.
  - **Ecosystems and Embedding**: Acknowledging these dynamics prompts inquiries into the broader ecosystems these objects are part of, indicating their roles and connections within.
- [[Dynamism]] and [[Emplacement]]???


### Insight 2 - Things that don't move
    Things that do not move through space can be subject to movement through time

### Insight 3 - Things that make time
    Some things create empty time that needs to be filled by other things

Below are also the points of insight 4

- **Unique Temporal Rhythms**: Objects possess distinct temporal patterns, diverging in how they experience and manifest time.
  - **Discrete Temporal Moments**: Items can be pinpointed at specific moments, yet each has its temporal flow.
  - **Divergent Experiences of Time**: There's a variance in temporal experiences among objects, highlighting their unique temporal identities.
  - **Interplay of Temporalities**: The differences and similarities in time experiences among objects and between objects and humans open avenues for exploring the essence of objects and their ecosystems.
  - **Visibility of Temporalities**: The nature or ecosystem of an object may reveal or emphasize specific temporal dynamics, making certain temporal patterns more observable.

### Insight 4 - Things that fill time
    Things occupy time and take up time. In some cases, things fill time

### Insight 5 - Things with power
    At times, things seem as if they are compelling the human partner to respond; for example, when the human is confronted with empty time

Below are also the points of insight 4

- **Agency in Objects**: The study suggests objects possess a form of agency, evident through their mobility and activity.
  - **Inherent Agency**: Objects demonstrate agency by altering their own and others' spatial and temporal existence, indicating an intrinsic capacity to affect change.
  - **Social Relationships Among Things**: Observing the interactions between objects reveals a network of social relations that frame their agency.
  - **Emergence of Potentialities**: The dynamics within object relationships highlight areas for reevaluation of spontaneity, purposefulness, and power beyond human subjectivity.
  - **Locating Power**: The concept of agency in objects prompts a reassessment of power distribution, suggesting it may reside outside traditional human-centric perspectives.

### Insight 6 - Things with politics
    Things may capture what might seem unremarkable to the researcher or participant. Thus, as through a peephole, they are crucial for filling in the gaps and revealing to humans unexpected moments and unaware practices
