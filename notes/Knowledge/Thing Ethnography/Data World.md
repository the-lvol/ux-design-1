# Data World
    Focusing on everyday home practices, we selected three mundane objects: a kettle, a fridge, and a cup. Because these objects are often in proximity, it was thought that together they would reveal insights not just about themselves but also about their relationships with each other – that is, about unexpected horizontal arrangements of various practices. We refer to the data concerning these arrangements and thus the ecosystems in which things become thoroughly imbricated as data worlds.

data worlds were aggregated into a visual narrative. These were analyzed in two ways: (1) timelines, which help us examine the 
sequence of events, temporal order and trajectories of objects, and (2) movie clips which showed the same scene from the perspective of our three objects, helping us explore what these objects ‘experience’ within the a specific time frame and context
