## Week 1 1/2-21 - Introduction to UX Design (for AI Infused Products)
In this lecture, you will get an introduction to the course. We will try to frame UX design concerning UI, interaction design, and user research, with a special focus on UX for "Smart Apps", also known as AI-infused products.

We will also go through the expectations for the course, the learning outcomes, the exam project and other practicalities.

### Readings
- [x] [[UX design innovation Challenges for working with machine learning as a design material]]
- [x] [[Adapting user experience research methods for AI-driven experiences]]
- [x] [[Re-examining whether, why, and how human-AI interaction is uniquely difficult to design]], Only need to read Section "Four Levels of AI Systems" P. 8-9

### Exercises

## Week 2 8/2-24 - Human AI Interaction Design Guidelines
In this class, we will discuss the current best practices in designing human-AI interaction. What does it mean to have good UX design for AI-infused products? How shall we evaluate AI products and experiences? We will look at some current industry guidelines, apply them to real applications, and discuss their limitations

### Readings
- [(x)] [[Guidelines for human-AI interaction]] (skipped how the guidelines were created, section 3 page 4 and onwards)
- [x] [[Intelligent Assistants Have Poor Usability A User Study of Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri]]
- Supplement: [Google AI Book](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/)

### Exercises
- [ ] Exercise 2

## Week 3 15/2-24 - Artificial Intelligence - Basic theory and hands-on practice
This class will provide a basic theoretical and practical introduction to Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Machine Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI.

### Readings
- None

## Week 4 22/2-24 - Lecture 4 [22/02]: Project 1 Presentations + Goal-based Persona
Teams will present their Project 1 results and receive feedback.

This class provides an overview of different methods to understand users and contexts. It discusses the challenges of understanding users and their needs for AI products. We will also discuss some AI-specific methods.

### Exercises
- Feedback on Project 1

### Readings
- [x] [[Modeling Users Personas and Goals]] Chapter 5

## Week 5 29/2-24 - TODO
This class continues the topic of User Research. You will learn other approaches to constructing personas, especially the emergent data-driven approaches. You will also learn a new method called Thing Ethnography, which allows UX designers to understand users through the lens of technology. It is particularly relevant to complex technology such as IoT and AI applications.

### Exercises
- Affinity diagramming
- Group work on projects

### Readings
- [x] [[Data-driven persona development]]
- [x] [[Thing ethnography Doing design research with non-humans]]
- [ ] [[Data-driven personas Constructing]]

## Week 6 7/3-24 - From Personas to Scenarios + Project Supervision
This class discusses how to go from personas to scenarios and requirements. We will also spend the second part of the course in project 2 supervision.

We will also have a guest lecture from Yana Boozova, UX designer at Maersk. She will talk about how the UX industry is currently using AI.

### Exercises
- In this exercise, we will give feedback to each group's ongoing process of Project 2

### Readings
- [ ] [[6 Slides]]
- [x] [[Cooper About Face Chapter 6]]

## Week 7 14/3-24 - Towards a Design Method for Positive AI (Guest Lecture)
This class is a design workshop. We will first give a lecture on the design method of Positive AI, which we will use for Project 3. This workshop will be divided into the following main parts:

- 12:15 - 13:15: Design Method for Positive Artificial Intelligence
- 13:30 - 14:30: Sprint 1: Contextualization and Operationalization (based on Positive AI framework)
- 14:45 - 16:00: Sprint 2: Ideate, Prototype, Test (based on traditional Design Thinking cycle)

### Exercises

### Readings
- [x] [[Developing and Evaluating a Design Method for Positive Artificial Intelligence]]

## Week 8 21/3-24 - Contextualization & Operationlization
In this lecture, we formally kick off Project 3: Designing an AI-infused product. Guided by the Positive AI framework, we will focus on 'Contextualization' and 'Operationalization'.

12:15 - 13:15: Project 2 Presentation and Feedback (Part I)
13:30 - 14:30: Contextualization - Understand and model wellbeing specific to the AI system's context.
14:45 - 15:45: Operationalization - Convert the wellbeing model into measurable indicators.

## Week 9 4/4-24 - Ideation
This lecture explores the Ideation stage of the UX design process. We'll examine its purpose in relation to other phases of design, and how to effectively engage participants in ideation sessions. The lecture will introduce a wide variety of ideation techniques such as Brainwriting, Bodystorming, the SCAMPER model, and Crazy 8s, followed by a practical workshop where these methods will be put into practice.

12:15 - 13:15: Project 2 Presentation and Feedback (Part II)
13:30 - 14:00: What is Ideation? Purpose, Process, and Effective Techniques
14:00 - 15:00: Practical Workshop on Ideation Methods
