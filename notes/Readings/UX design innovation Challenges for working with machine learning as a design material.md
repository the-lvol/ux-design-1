# UX design innovation Challenges for working with machine learning as a design material
See [[UX design innovation Challenges for working with machine learning as a design material.pdf]]

## Abstract
Why is there so little innovation in UI that utilizes ML technologies?

## Introduction
Several reasons why ML is difficult to design for
- UX designers don't understand how ML works, it's like magic
- ML as a statistical machine is a hard material to design for
- UX designers are not taught how to design for ML

ML and UX is an underutilized combination that should be taken advantage of

Survey of UX designers --> hard to sketch, ideate and prototype ML products

## Technical HCI and ML
Technical HCI have used ML to e.g. gesture detection, estimate if a person is depressed and more

## The Challenges of "Intelligent" Technology
It boils down to the debate of "do it for me" or "do it myself"

When using an agent to perform a task, giving it a physical representation of stuff like gender and ethnicity needs to be taken into consideration as it can affect the model

## Challenges When Working With ML
3 main challenges were identified

### Difficulty in Understanding ML and its Capabilities
UX designers have difficulties understanding what ML is and how it works, which makes it more difficult to use

### Challenges With ML As A Design Material
If you can't see a use case, it can be difficult to create a design

Collaboration with ML specialists is required to prototype and develop designs

### Challenges With The Purposeful Use Of ML
Instead of focusing on what ML can do, maybe ask what can we use it for. Taking the human in the center and thereby, putting the designer and developer on the same level
